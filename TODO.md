# TODO

- [ ] Parse all files in the repo on init
- [ ] Perform incremental updates instead
- [ ] Maybe just use an index of identifier => uri and then run through the AST
  in those files on every search? That would be less state and I doubt people
  have HUGE bash files.
- [ ] Look up man pages / --help to show inline help
